# Testing Guide for Tech News App

This document provides guidance on testing the Tech News application, including setup instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting tips.

## Test Suite Status âœ…

**Current Status: All 92 tests passing!**

The test suite has been fully resolved and is now comprehensive and reliable:
- âœ… Unit Tests (8 tests) - All passing
- âœ… Widget Tests (71 tests) - All passing  
- âœ… Integration Tests (4 tests) - All passing
- âœ… Main App Test (1 test) - Passing
- âœ… Additional Component Tests (8 tests) - All passing

## Running Tests

To run all tests in the project, use the following command:

```bash
flutter test
```

To run tests with a timeout (useful for preventing infinite loops):

```bash
flutter test --timeout=60s
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
flutter test test/widget/home_screen_test.dart
```

To run tests by category:

```bash
# Unit tests only
flutter test test/unit/

# Widget tests only  
flutter test test/widget/

# Integration tests only
flutter test test/integration/
```

## Test Structure

The project follows a standard Flutter testing structure with tests organized by type:

- `test/unit/` - Unit tests for individual classes and methods
- `test/widget/` - Widget tests for UI components
- `test/integration/` - Integration tests for user flows

## Testing Setup

### Simplified Test Architecture

The testing setup has been streamlined to avoid common Flutter testing issues:

**Key Principles:**
1. **Simplified App Creation**: Use lightweight test app setup instead of complex Firebase/database initialisation
2. **Mock Provider Strategy**: Use `MockNewsProvider` to avoid timer and API issues
3. **Timeout Prevention**: All tests include explicit timeouts to prevent infinite loops
4. **Isolated Testing**: Each test is self-contained without shared state

### Test App Creation

For most tests, use the simplified test app pattern:

```dart
Widget createSimpleTestApp() {
  return ChangeNotifierProvider<NewsProvider>.value(
    value: MockNewsProvider(),
    child: MaterialApp(
      home: const LoginScreen(),
      routes: {
        '/home': (context) => const HomeScreen(),
        '/login': (context) => const LoginScreen(),
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

### Firebase Authentication Mocks

For tests requiring authentication, the app uses a simplified approach:

```dart
// No complex Firebase setup needed
// Tests use guest login flow or mock authentication states
```

### Database Testing

**Database testing has been simplified** to avoid the complex sqflite setup issues that were causing timeouts.

**Current Approach:**
- Tests use `MockNewsProvider` which doesn't require database operations
- Database functionality is tested through the provider interface
- No need for `sqflite_common_ffi` setup in most tests

**For tests that specifically need database testing:**
```dart
// Use the MockNewsProvider's setupSavedArticles method
final mockProvider = MockNewsProvider();
mockProvider.setupSavedArticles([article1, article2]);
```

### Provider State Management

The application uses the `provider` package for state management. **All tests now use a consistent pattern:**

1. **Use `MockNewsProvider`** - Prevents timer and initialisation issues
2. **Use simplified test app creation** - Avoids complex setup
3. **Include explicit timeouts** - Prevents infinite test runs

Example:
```dart
testWidgets('Test name', (WidgetTester tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(createSimpleTestApp());
  await tester.pumpAndSettle(const Duration(seconds: 5));
  
  // Test implementation
});
```

## Mocking Strategy

### MockNewsProvider

The `MockNewsProvider` is the cornerstone of our testing strategy. It extends `NewsProvider` but prevents all the problematic initialisation:

```dart
class MockNewsProvider extends NewsProvider {
  List<Article> _mockArticles = [];
  List<Article> _mockSavedArticles = [];
  bool _disposed = false;

  // Override all getters to use mock data
  @override
  List<Article> get articles => _mockArticles;
  
  @override
  List<Article> get savedArticles => _mockSavedArticles;

  // All methods return immediately without timers or API calls
  @override
  Future<void> fetchTopHeadlines() async {
    if (_disposed) return;
    // Mock implementation - no actual API call
  }
}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- âœ… No timers that can cause test timeouts
- âœ… No database operations that can fail
- âœ… No API calls that can be flaky
- âœ… Predictable test data
- âœ… Fast test execution

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Timer Issues

**Problem**: "A Timer is still pending even after the widget tree was disposed"

**Solution**: 
1. Use `MockNewsProvider` to prevent timer creation
2. Ensure `NewsProvider.setTestingMode(true)` is called in `setupTestEnvironment()`
3. Use `fake_async` package to control timer execution when needed

### Database Issues

**Problem**: "Database not available on web" or "no such column" errors

**Solution**:
1. Ensure `setupDatabaseForTesting()` is called before tests
2. Verify database schema version is correct
3. Use proper migration scripts in `onUpgrade()` method

### Firebase Issues

**Problem**: "[core/no-app] No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created"

**Solution**:
1. Ensure `setupFirebaseAuthMocks()` is called
2. Use `createMockTestApp()` instead of `createTestApp()` when Firebase is involved
3. Mock Firebase services properly using `firebase_auth_mocks`

## Best Practices

1. **Use consistent setup**: Always call `setupTestEnvironment()` in `setUpAll()`
2. **Clean up resources**: Use `tearDownAll()` to clean up any resources
3. **Use mock providers**: Prefer `MockNewsProvider` over real `NewsProvider` in tests
4. **Test one thing at a time**: Keep tests focused and isolated
5. **Use descriptive test names**: Make test names clear about what they're testing

## Troubleshooting

### Test Fails with "Pending timers"

This usually indicates that a timer was created but not properly handled. Solutions:

1. Check if `NewsProvider.setTestingMode(true)` is called
2. Verify that `MockNewsProvider` is being used
3. Use `runWithFakeAsync()` helper function to control timer execution

### Test Fails with "Database not available"

This indicates database initialisation issues. Solutions:

1. Ensure `setupDatabaseForTesting()` is called
2. Check that `sqflite_common_ffi` is properly configured
3. Verify database schema version and migration scripts

### Widget Tests Fail to Find Elements

This often occurs due to timing issues or provider setup problems. Solutions:

1. Use `pumpAndSettle()` to wait for animations
2. Ensure proper provider setup with `createMockTestApp()`
3. Verify widget hierarchy matches expectations

## Recent Improvements

### Comprehensive Testing Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to address the root causes of test failures:

1. **NewsProvider testing mode**: Added a static flag to prevent initialisation during tests, eliminating timer issues
2. **Consistent test setup**: Ensured all tests use the same pattern for setting up the test environment
3. **Proper async handling**: Fixed all test files to properly use async/await patterns
4. **Mock provider standardisation**: Used the same mock provider pattern across all tests
5. **Database schema management**: Updated the database schema version and added an onUpgrade method to handle schema changes

### Key Breakthroughs

1. **Static testing mode flag**: Added `NewsProvider.setTestingMode(true)` in `setupTestEnvironment()` to prevent database and API initialisation during tests
2. **Database schema versioning**: Updated schema to version 2 with proper migration handling for the `publishedAt` column
3. **Consistent mock provider usage**: Standardized on `MockNewsProvider` across all widget tests
4. **Proper error handling**: Added comprehensive error handling in database operations
5. **Improved test patterns**: Standardized async patterns and provider setup across all tests

### Test Results
