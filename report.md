# Application Publishing Report

To make the Tech News application publishable on platforms like Google Play Store and Apple App Store, several amendments are required to comply with platform guidelines and ensure a professional user experience. These changes address privacy, security, user experience, and technical requirements.

## App Icons and Splash Screen
The application requires proper app icons and splash screen to meet platform guidelines. Currently, placeholder icons are used. According to Google Play's [Icon Design Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/google-play/resources/icon-design-specifications) and Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons), apps must have properly sized icons for all device resolutions. The app needs custom icons in various sizes (48x48, 72x72, 96x96, 144x144, 192x192 for Android; 20x20, 29x29, 40x40, 60x60, 76x76, 83.5x83.5 for iOS) and a branded splash screen that follows platform-specific design principles.

## Privacy Policy and Data Handling
A comprehensive privacy policy is essential for compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and platform requirements. The app collects user data through Firebase Authentication and location services, requiring transparent disclosure of data collection, storage, and usage practices. Google Play's [Data safety section](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469) and Apple's [App Privacy](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) guidelines mandate clear privacy information. The app should include a privacy policy page accessible from the settings menu, explaining data collection for personalisation, authentication, and analytics.

## Terms of Service
Implementing terms of service is crucial for legal protection and user agreement. These terms should cover acceptable use, intellectual property rights, disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Both platforms require apps to have terms that protect users and developers while complying with local laws.

## App Description and Store Listing
A compelling app description with relevant keywords is needed for app store optimisation (ASO). The description should highlight key features like voice search, QR code scanning, and location-based personalisation while incorporating SEO-friendly keywords. High-quality screenshots and promotional videos demonstrating the app's functionality are required for both stores to improve conversion rates.

## API Key Security
The application currently uses hardcoded API keys for Firebase and NewsAPI. For production, these keys must be secured using environment variables or secure storage solutions. Google Play's [Security Policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10791223) and Apple's [App Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) prohibit exposing sensitive credentials in code. Implementing secure key management using tools like flutter_dotenv or platform-specific secure storage is essential.

## Analytics and Crash Reporting
Integrating analytics (e.g., Firebase Analytics) and crash reporting (e.g., Sentry, Crashlytics) is necessary for monitoring user engagement and identifying issues. These tools help track user behaviour, feature usage, and performance metrics, enabling data-driven improvements. Both platforms encourage developers to implement robust error tracking to ensure app stability.

## Performance Optimisation
The app requires optimisation for size and performance. Google Play recommends APK sizes under 150MB, while Apple has similar App Store size limits. Implementing code minification, resource compression, and lazy loading will improve download times and user experience. The app should also optimise battery usage, particularly for location services and background processes, to comply with platform energy guidelines.

These amendments ensure the application meets platform requirements for privacy, security, and user experience, making it suitable for publication on major app stores.
